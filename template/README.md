# Nuxt Star Admin

Admin Template base on [Vue StarAdmin](https://github.com/BootstrapDash/StarAdmin-Free-Vue-Admin-Template) with improved on design and served using Nuxt.js

## Why

**Nakama Design** always try to aware with other developer needs, a few weeks ago we found [Vue StarAdmin](https://github.com/BootstrapDash/StarAdmin-Free-Vue-Admin-Template) and we think can contribute on the project. So, we create this boilerplate that can use **Vue StarAdmin** on [Nuxt.js](https://github.com/nuxt) too.

Also, you can use this boilerplate personally or for your company too. Feel free to create issue if you have any problem. Or, you can contact us on e-mail at [we.are@nakama.design](mailto:we.are@nakama.design).
